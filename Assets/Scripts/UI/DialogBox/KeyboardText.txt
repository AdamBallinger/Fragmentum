Knight Gawain: Sir Thanatos! Get in Here!
Knight Gawain: The King is on leave and has asked me to watch over the kingdom until he returns...
Knight Gawain: Before he left he had a special request from you...
Knight Gawain: The Kings wizards have predicted dark times ahead with threat from dark forces. Citizens have reported that they have seen frightening creatures throughout the kingdom!...
Knight Gawain: The wizards believe these creatures get their power from the Fragments of Angst which we know have been missing for centuries! It is said who ever holds all of these fragments will have unimaginable power!
Knight Gawain: Just imagine what good it would be for our kingdom and its people!... 
Knight Gawain: The King has taken his army with him and I must keep watch over the kingdom so that leaves you...And so I must ask something of you...
Knight Gawain: You must venture out into the kingdom and retrieve the Fragments of Angst, all the while destroying these mysterious creatures! Bring back the fragments to me...
Knight Gawain: and I will ensure they are kept safe. Do you accept this quest?
*Silence*...
...
Knight Gawain: I take that as a yes! Citizens have reported sightings of creatures in The Gloom forest, that seems like a good place to begin! Go Sir Thanatos! Help restore faith to your kingdom!
Knight Gawain: Hey wait! Where is your sword?
*Silence*...
